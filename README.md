Hey there! I develop Android apps for a living. I feel fortunate because it is
also something I am really passionate about. I am currently working with
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) as an **Android Engineer III** and
previously worked with [EqualExperts](https://equalexperts.com) and
[ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com).

I have years of experience in building scalable mobile apps for various
domains, including Music, E-Governance, Entertainment, Fintech, and Travel.
have worked extensively on Android, Kotlin, and Java, and have delivered
scalable solutions. I have been working with teams to understand, solve,
develop, and deliver end-to-end solutions using agile engineering practices,
such as **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **Pair Programming**,
**Continuous Integration/Delivery**, and **Test Automation**.

Currently, I am collaborating with the product and design team to enhance 
various aspects of the app and working on breaking down complex requirements 
into actionable tasks.
